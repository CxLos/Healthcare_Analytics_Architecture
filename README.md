# üìö Patient Check-In Data Pipeline

## üìù Description

This project demonstrates a **real-time healthcare data pipeline** using **Apache Kafka** for event streaming, **Python** for data generation and consumption, and **Plotly Dash** for interactive visualization. The simulation generates live patient check-in events from multiple hospital departments (Cardiology, Oncology, Pediatrics), streams them into a Kafka topic, and consumes them to update a live dashboard in real time.  

It showcases how healthcare organizations could use a streaming architecture to monitor operational metrics, detect patterns, and improve decision-making without relying on static batch reports. While this is a simulated dataset, the architecture reflects real-world use cases in **healthcare analytics, streaming data pipelines, and real-time dashboards**.

## üì¶ Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CxLos/Healthcare_Analytics_Architecture
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Healthcare_Analytics_Architecture
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

- This is an interactive Plotly/Dash dashboard that updates in real time.  
- The Kafka **producer** generates synthetic patient check-in events every 2 seconds.  
- The Kafka **consumer** listens to the same topic and pushes updates to the dashboard. 

- To launch the dashboard locally:
    ```bash
    python healthcare_analytics.py
    ```

## üß™ Methodology

### Data Generation

- Synthetic patient check-ins are created with:

    - `patient_id`: random 4-digit number.
    - `check_in_time`: current timestamp.
    - `department`: randomly selected from `["Cardiology", "Oncology", "Pediatrics"]`.

### Streaming Layer

- **Producer**: Sends JSON-encoded events to Kafka topic `patient_checkins`.
- **Consumer**: Reads events in real time and stores them in a thread-safe queue for visualization.

### Visualization Layer

- **Plotly Dash** app updates every 3 seconds.
- Displays a time-series line chart showing the count of check-ins per department over time.

## Results

### üîç Insights

- Demonstrates the low-latency capabilities of Kafka for healthcare operations.
- Simulates departmental workload trends in real time.
- Provides a blueprint for scaling into more complex event-driven healthcare analytics.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project illustrates how Apache Kafka can serve as the backbone for real-time healthcare analytics pipelines. By integrating streaming data with an interactive dashboard, hospitals and clinics can gain instant visibility into patient flow and department activity. The same architecture could be extended to integrate with machine learning models for predictive patient flow management, anomaly detection, or automated alerts.
